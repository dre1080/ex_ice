1. Should we filter out bridges (like those created by docker) when gathering host candidates?

3. How does iptables work? (In particular NAT table, and MASQUERADE and DNAT targets)

5. Is it possible to connect ice outside docker with ice inside docker?
6. Is it possible for initial pair state to be different than :waiting when we have only one checklist? 
7. Is it possible not to prune some srflx candidate - sec 6.1.2.4?
8. Is it possible to receive binding response to binding request with USE-CANDIDATE that will result in creating
a new valid pair? sec 7.2.5.3.4
