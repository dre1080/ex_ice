1. Should we filter out bridges (like those created by docker) when gathering host candidates?
2. When conn check req and resp address might not be symmetric? sec 7.2.5.2.1
3. How does iptables work? (In particular NAT table, and MASQUERADE and DNAT targets)
4. Is it actually possible to have srflx candidate? reflexive candidates are replaced by their bases
and pruned if redundant - see section 6.1.2.4
5. Is it possible to connect ice outside docker with ice inside docker?
6. Is it possible for initial pair state to be different than :waiting when we have only one checklist? 
7. Is it possible not to prune some srflx candidate - sec 6.1.2.4?
8. Is it possible to receive binding response to binding request with USE-CANDIDATE that will result in creating
a new valid pair? sec 7.2.5.3.4
9. A Trickle ICE agent MUST NOT pair a local candidate until it has been trickled to the remote party. 
- How can we know that the candidate has been trickled to the remote party? Does any implementation
exposes in its API ability to mark the candidate as trickled?
10. What data use for keepalives and how often?
Chrome seems to send binding requests every 2-2.5s which is a discouraged behavior
according to appendinx B.8 of RFC 8445.
Chrome also sends those keepalives even when the data is flowing which is also
an opposite behavior comparing to what RFC says.
Pion seems to send Binding Indications 2 seconds after there is no traffic.
In general, we should send Binding Indications and only when there is no media traffic.
RFC says that we should send keepalives after 15 seconds of inactivity.
"Though Binding Indications are used for
keepalives, an agent MUST be prepared to receive a connectivity check
as well.  If a connectivity check is received, a response is
generated as discussed in [RFC5389], but there is no impact on ICE
processing otherwise."
