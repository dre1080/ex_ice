1. Should we filter out bridges (like those created by docker) when gathering host candidates?
2. When conn check req and resp address might not be symmetric? sec 7.2.5.2.1
3. How does iptables work? (In particular NAT table, and MASQUERADE and DNAT targets)
4. Is it actually possible to have srflx candidate? reflexive candidates are replaced by their bases
and pruned if redundant - see section 6.1.2.4
5. Is it possible to connect ice outside docker with ice inside docker?
